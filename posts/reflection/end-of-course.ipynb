    "In this section I'll ask you to fill in some data. You don't have to give precise numbers -- approximate, conversational responses are fine. For example, when I ask \"how often did you attend class,\" good answers include \"almost always,\" \"I missed three times,\" \"about 75% of the time,\" \"not as often as I wanted,\" etc. \n",

    "### Presence in Class\n",
    "\n",
    "- *How often did you attend class? (e.g. \"almost always,\" \"I missed three times,\" etc.)* Always\n",
    "- *How often did you take notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?* Never, but I have read them almost every time (I think I may have missed a reading once or twice).\n",
    "- *How often were you **prepared** to present the daily warm-up exercise to your team, even if you weren't actually called?* Always\n",
    "- *How many times did you **actually** present the daily warm-up to your team?* Maybe 5 or 6 times, I've also helped others present a handful of times.\n",
    "- *How many times did you ask your team for help while presenting the daily warm-up?* I've definitely discussed my results with my team to make sure I was generally correct, but I don't think I've asked my team for help for something I fully didn't know/didn't prepare beforehand.\n",
    "- *How often did you learn something new from a teammate's presentation of the daily warm-up?* I think while the answers were generally the same, I tended to learn a new technique or way of looking at a problem when people presented their warm-ups!\n",

    "I think my theory portion from the mid-course reflection stands here, but I was very happy to refresh myself on my calculus and linear algebra skills! Getting practice with gradient descent and Hessian matrices was also great, as I didn't have much experience with either coming into this class. Similarly, I think my thoughts on implementation are similar to my mid-course reflection, but I've now had more practice to cement these ideas. In particular, I spent a lot of the second half of this semester learning how and when to use vectorized functions, especially with regard to tensors and other size-constrained data structures like numpy arrays. Finally, I think I've also been able to identify sources of bias and have candid and critical discussions about them. Working on my project allowed me to see these sources of bias appear in more subtle ways. For instance, I didn't at first notice how our model for noisy speech identification could be biased based on the fact that the dataset is entirely in English. While this is obvious if I were to stop and think about it, I needed (and still need) practice in identifying these more implicit bias factors."

    "I'm extremely happy with how I ended up in terms of my blog posts. I think I did a good job at increasing my pace and learning a lot in the process, completing my original goal of 7 blog posts. Additionally, I'm satisfied with my ability to consistently revise in order to get all of the blog posts up to an E. I think I could've spaced out the posts more evenly, but there wasn't really a point where they felt too overwhelming, even toward the end. Super happy with my accomplishments/quality of work here!"

I tried my best to help my groupmates during warm-ups when they needed it and made sure to prepare for class (reading, doing the warmup, etc.) before almost all classes. While we didn't have many ethical discussions in class since the mid-semester warmup, I'm still proud of the conversations that I had in class and my ability to express my opinions. I felt that all of my goals were met in this regard."

    "I was happy to get a chance to work with audio, especially in a new way -- classification is different than what I've done with it before! As mentioned in my blog post for the project, I would have loved to do more, but that would have been going above and beyond my goals (and the time that I had to work on the project). I also got the opportunity to improve in terms of learning how audio is represented to machines (noted as a goal in my mid-semester post). While not originally how I intended regarding type standards (float vs integer, etc.), I learned more optimal ways of feeding machines audio data. Learning how to use mels-spectrograms to train models was really valuable, I feel."
